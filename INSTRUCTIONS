== Purpose ==

Implement a (backdoored) password generator in the following steps:
	
	Step 1: Add an ecall to generate_password() in the password_generator.edl file
	Step 2: Write the necessary code in main() to create, call and finally destroy the enclave
	Step 3: Modify the *.edl file so that it is up to the programmer to perform the necessary security checks. Also include those checks in the body of the generate_password() function
	Step 4: Write an ocall to leak every 64-bit random number when it is generated
	Step 5: Write another ocall to leak the generated password
	Step 6: Check how a sealing key can be requested and seal the generated password before it is returned to unprotected memory.

== Cleaning ==

To clear all objects files:

	> make clean

To also clear the private/public key pair, execute:
	
	> make scrub

== Building ==

If there is no public/private key pair, execute:
	
	> make configure

To build the enclave and enclave:
	
	> make

== Running ==

Simply execute:
	
	> ./inc

== Debugging ==

In case of problems, don't forget to check the kernel logs for output from the SGX driver:

	> tail -f /var/log/syslog
